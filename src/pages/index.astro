    <p>I'm Luke, a software engineer loves to code.</p>
    <p>
      If you're here, I imagine you either want to look at cool things I've
      made, read cool things I've written or contact me. So feel free I guess!
    </p>
    <p class="font-semibold text-xl">About Me</p>
    <p>
      I'm a software dev by trade, dabbling in anything I find interesting. I
      mainly work on front ends, build tools and CI builds, but love exploring
      everything else.
    </p>

    <p>
      I love open source and try to keep 100% of the code I write public and
      free where possible (even the bad stuff!).
    </p>
    <p>
      If I'm not coding I'm usually improv'ing or freestyle rapping with some
      friends in a park somewhere or checking out a local breweries.
